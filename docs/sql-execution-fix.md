# SQL Execution Fix

## Problem
When clicking "הרץ שאילתה" (Run Query) in the homework runner, nothing happened. Console errors showed:
1. **404 error** on `/api/submissions/{id}/save-draft` 
2. **400 error** on `/api/sql/execute`

## Root Cause
The application had **two parallel implementations**:
- **Mock data** in `app/api/_mock/homeworkStore.ts` (for demo/development)
- **Real database** in `lib/submissions.ts` (for production)

The API routes were mixed - some used mock, some used database, causing inconsistencies when real MongoDB data was created through the builder interface.

## Solution

### 1. Unified API Routes to Use Database
Updated both routes to use the real database implementation:

**`app/api/sql/execute/route.ts`**
- Changed from mock to `@/lib/submissions`
- Added detailed server-side logging
- Better error messages

**`app/api/submissions/[setId]/save-draft/route.ts`**
- Changed from mock to `@/lib/submissions`
- Added logging and error handling

### 2. Implemented Real SQL Execution
**`lib/submissions.ts` - `executeSqlForSubmission()`**

The function now:
1. ✅ Fetches the question from MongoDB
2. ✅ Fetches the homework set to get dataset info
3. ✅ Loads the dataset configuration
4. ✅ Uses **SQL.js** to execute queries in-browser (server-side)
5. ✅ Returns properly formatted results with feedback
6. ✅ Handles errors gracefully with meaningful messages

### 3. Added Fallback Sample Data
For testing and when no dataset is configured, the system automatically creates a sample `Employees` table with 5 rows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department TEXT,
  salary REAL,
  hire_date TEXT
);

-- 5 sample employees inserted
```

This allows `SELECT * FROM Employees` to work immediately!

### 4. Enhanced Debugging

**Client-side logging (browser console):**
- 🔴 When execute button is clicked
- 🔵 When mutation runs
- 🟢 SQL query being executed
- ✅ Success messages
- ❌ Error messages

**Server-side logging (terminal):**
- 🟦 API endpoint called with payload
- 💾 Draft save attempts
- ⚠️ Warnings for missing data
- ✅ Successful operations
- ❌ Detailed error information

## How SQL Execution Works Now

```
1. Student clicks "הרץ שאילתה" button
   ↓
2. Client sends POST to /api/sql/execute with:
   - setId (homework set ID)
   - questionId
   - sql (the query)
   - studentId
   ↓
3. Server (lib/submissions.ts):
   a. Loads question from MongoDB
   b. Loads homework set to find dataset
   c. Loads dataset configuration
   d. Initializes SQL.js in memory
   e. Loads database (or creates sample data)
   f. Executes the SQL query
   g. Returns results + feedback
   ↓
4. Client displays:
   - Result table with data
   - Execution time
   - Feedback score
   - Success celebration (if score ≥ 80)
```

## Testing

To test SQL execution:
1. Navigate to any homework runner page
2. Type: `SELECT * FROM Employees;`
3. Click "הרץ שאילתה"
4. Should see 5 employees in results table

## Future Improvements

1. **Dataset Management**: Create proper datasets with real SQLite files
2. **Query Validation**: Add expected result comparison for auto-grading
3. **Performance**: Cache database loading
4. **Security**: Add query timeout and resource limits
5. **Advanced Scoring**: Implement rubric-based evaluation

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/submissions.ts` - Real SQL execution implementation
2. `/app/api/sql/execute/route.ts` - Fixed to use database
3. `/app/api/submissions/[setId]/save-draft/route.ts` - Fixed to use database
4. `/app/homework/runner/[setId]/RunnerClient.tsx` - Added debug logging

## Dependencies

- `sql.js` - Already in package.json
- SQL.js CDN for WASM files
- MongoDB for storing homework/questions/submissions
