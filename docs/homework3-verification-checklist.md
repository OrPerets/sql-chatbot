# Homework 3 Question Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm that questions 1-10 in Homework 3 match the official exercise.

1. Navigate to the builder interface for Homework 3: `/homework/builder/[setId]`.
2. For each question (1-10), confirm:
   - The prompt text matches the exercise document.
   - Instructions are fully visible and rendered in the editor preview.
   - Expected result schema columns reflect the exercise table definitions.
   - Point values align with the grading rubric.
3. Update any discrepancies directly in the builder and save changes.
4. After edits, re-open the runner to confirm prompts and instructions appear as expected.

Record findings or mismatches in the course tracking system so they can be resolved before the deadline.
