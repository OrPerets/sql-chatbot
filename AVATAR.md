## Enhancement Goals

### 1. **Interactive User Engagement**
- **Click/Touch Interactions**: Make avatar respond to user clicks with contextual gestures
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle animations when user hovers over avatar
- **User Input Reactions**: Avatar gestures based on user's SQL queries, questions, or typing patterns
- **Celebration Gestures**: Special animations for correct answers, achievements, or milestones

### 2. **Contextual Gesture System**
- **Query-Based Gestures**: 
  - `thumbup` for successful SQL queries
  - `thinking` pose for complex queries
  - `index` for pointing at specific SQL concepts
  - `shrug` for unclear questions
- **Learning Progress Gestures**:
  - `ok` for completing exercises
  - `handup` for asking questions
  - `namaste` for greeting/ending sessions
- **Error Handling Gestures**:
  - Gentle `thumbdown` for syntax errors (with encouraging follow-up)
  - `side` gesture for alternative approaches

### 3. **Personalized Avatar Behavior**
- **User Preference Learning**: Track user's preferred interaction style
- **Adaptive Mood System**: Avatar mood changes based on user's learning progress
- **Session Memory**: Remember user's name, progress, and interaction patterns
- **Customizable Gestures**: Allow users to set favorite gestures for common actions

### 4. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- **Micro-Interactions**: Subtle head nods, eye movements, and facial expressions
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual representation of learning milestones through avatar changes
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Avatar expressions that match the learning context
- **Accessibility Features**: High-contrast mode, reduced motion options

### 5. **Performance & Reliability**
